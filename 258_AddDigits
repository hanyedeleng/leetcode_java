Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit.
For example:
Given num = 38, the process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
Follow up:
Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?

Thought: we can use the string to value or int to string and recursion to solve it.
Integer.toString(i)
Integer.parseInt("1234");
s.length  s.charAt(i)

Use the hint, all the possible results is occured periodically.

public class Solution {
    public int addDigits(int num) {
        if (num<10) {
            return num;
        } else {
            if (num%9==0) {
                return 9;
            }
        }
        return num%9;
    }
}

ont line solution:
return num>9?(num%9==0?9:num%9):num;


Tips: remember to test the result before submit.
